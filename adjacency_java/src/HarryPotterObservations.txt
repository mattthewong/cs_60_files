Harry:  I'm not going home. Not really.\
Hermione to Ron: [ Has anyone seen a toad? A boy named Neville's lost one.,  Oh, are you doing magic? Let's see then.,  Are you sure that's a real spell? Well, it's not very good, is it? Of course I've only tried a few simple spells myself, and they've all worked for me. For example...\{Hermione goes over and sits across from Harry. He points her hand at his glasses and Harry tenses\} Oculus Reparo. \{The glasses, which noseband is battered, are repaired. Harry takes them off, amazed.\} That's better, isn't it? Holy Cricket, you're Harry Potter. I'm Hermione Granger...and you are...?,  Oh, no. Okay, relax. \{She goes up\},  Up. Up. Up. Up.,  You won't make a fool of yourself. It's in your blood.,  Oh, move over! \{pushes through and pulls out wand\} Alohomora. \{The door opens.\} Get in. \{They bustle in.\},  Filch is gone.,  You don't use your eyes, do you? Didn't you see what it was standing on?,  That's right. Now, if you two don't mind, I'm going to bed before either of you come up with another clever idea to get us killed...or worse, expelled! \{turns and leaves, shutting the door to her dorms.\},  Stop, stop, stop. You're going to take someone's eye out. Besides, youre saying it wrong. It's Leviosa, not Leviosar.,  Help! Help! \{The boys start throwing wood pieces at the troll.\},  Swish and flick!,  It's Snape! He's jinxing the broom!,  Leave it to me. \{She hands Ron her binoculars and leaves.\},  That's totally barbaric!,  See you haven't.,  Good. You can help Harry, then. He's going to go the library for information on Nicholas Flamel.,  Not in the restricted section...Happy Christmas. \{exits.\},  I had you looking in the wrong section! How could I be so stupid? I checked this out a few weeks ago for a bit of light reading.,  Honestly, don't you two read? "The Philosopher's Stone is a legendary substance with astonishing powers. It will turn any metal into pure gold and produces the Elixir of Life, which will make the drinker immortal.",  It means you'll never die.,  Is that...a dragon?,  Hang on a minute. We're forgetting one thing. Who's the one wizard Voldemort always feared? I've always heard Hogwarts' end of the year exams were frightful, but I found that rather enjoyable.,  Neville, I'm really, really sorry about this...\{takes out wand\} Petrificus Totalus.,  Sorry.,  Ow! You stood on my foot!,  Alohomora.,  The harp. It stopped playing.,  Stop moving, both of you. This is Devil's Snare. You have to relax. If you don't, it will only kill you faster.,  Do what I say. Trust me.,  Uh! I remember reading something in Herbology. ,  Um Devil's Snare, Devil's Scare,  it's deadly fun...but will sulk in the sun! That's it! Devil's Snare hates sunlight!  Lumus Solem! ,  Ugh! What're we going to do? There must be 1000 keys up there!,  Now what do we do?,  What happens now?,  Ron, you don't suppose this is going to be like...real wizard's chess, do you?,  No, Ron, you can't! \{Ron closes his eyes.\} There must be another way!]\
Hermione to Harry: [ Harry, no! You heard what Madam Hooch said! Besides, you don't even know how to fly. \{Harry flies off.\} What an idiot.,  \{Gasps.\},  The staircases change, remember? \{The staircase stops, in a new place.\},  We're not supposed to be here. This is the 3rd floor. It's forbidden.,  It was locked.,  It was standing on a trap door. Which means it wasn't there by accident. It's guarding something.,  Ahhh! Help!,  Is it...dead?,  Ron's right, Harry. You're gonna need your strength today.,  Blood?,  But why would anyone go near that dog?,  So you're saying...,  Bit early for mail, isn't it?,  Hogwarts teacher or not, I know a curse when I see one. I've read all about them. You have to keep eye contact. And Snape wasn't blinking.,  I don't know.,  \{glares\} Of course! Here it is! "Nicholas Flamel is the only known maker of the Philosopher's Stone!",  "The only stone currently in existence belongs to Mr. Nicholas Flamel, the noted alchemist, who last year celebrated his 665th birthday!" That's what Fluffy's guarding on the 3rd floor. That's what's under the trapdoor...the Philosopher's Stone!,  You mean, You-Know-Who's out there, right now, in the forest?,  It's happened before.,  What is it?,  Now what do we do?,  Just relax!,  Are you okay?,  He's not relaxing, is he?,  We've got to do something!,  What is that?,  Curious. I've never seen birds like these.,  What's this all about?,  What's wrong, Harry?,  I don't like this. I don't like this at all.,  What is it?,  You'll be okay, Harry. You're a great wizard, you really are.,  \{smile\} Me? Books and cleverness? There are more important things. Friendship, and bravery. And Harry, just be careful.,  Come on, Harry.,  Feels strange to be going home, doesn't it?]\

Observations:\
\
1.The philosophers stone has great powers that will turn any substance into gold and produces a drink that makes the drinker immortal.\
2. Harry is rebellious and courageous, always putting bravery before friend\'92s advice!\
\
3. Hermione\'92s insults toward Ron are a direct reflection of her flirtatious nature and feelings toward him.\
