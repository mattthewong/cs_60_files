;; *************************************
;;   Part B - Power
;; *************************************

;power takes two non-negative integers, with the term 'base' as the base raised to the power of user-defined 'pow'.

(define (power base pow)
  
  (if (equal? pow 0)
      1
  (* base (power base (- pow 1)))))


; provided tests
(check-expect (power 2 10) 1024)
(check-expect (power 42 10) 17080198121677824)

;my test cases
(check-expect (power 2 3) 8)
(check-expect (power 2 0) 1)


;; *************************************
;;   Part C - Fast-Power
;; *************************************

;fast-power has identical inputs to power, but runs faster / more efficiently.

#|What could explain why there is so much variation in the time it takes for each one and why the result
is that we donâ€™t see a clear linear pattern?

Maybe the fact that we are using a recursion call for our power function that could be made simpler
could play a role in the variation in runtimes for each test; this creates a varying amount of work for the computer
depending on when the test is run because the computer is also processing other information.

;essentially takes an extremely large exponent to make even a slight difference in cpu time, real time, or gc time
;(aka gc: 1 versus gc = 0)
