\
Real-world examples (not used in class) of something that runs: \
\
N times: I give someone a hug at school.\
\
N^2 times: Everyone at school gives a hug to everyone else at school. \
\
N^3 times: Every possible group of three people at CMC participate in a tri-high five.\
\
N + M times: I give everyone a high five at CMC and everyone a hug at Mudd.\
\
N * M times: Everyone at CMC gives everyone at Mudd a high five.\
